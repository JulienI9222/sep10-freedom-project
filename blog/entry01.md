# Entry 1: Getting Started 

##### 10/14/24

I have been fascinated with buildings and different style of buildings for a long time so I chose Architecture as my topic. To get started on how I can demostrate how technology impacts architecture I had to do a lot of research. The first thing I learned was I needed to really grow my skills in JavaScript, Python, and C++ if I was going to build my own floorplans. So I decided I needed to practice using <a href="[url]([floorplanner.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org))">Free Code Camp</a> . I also found some free online lessons in Python on <a href="[url]((https://python.land/python-tutorial))">Python Land</a>

Getting comfortable using this type of code to build floor plans was going to take a lot of time and tinkering and I needed to be patient in this process. 

<p> When searching for resources to create my project I was having a hard time finding free websites to create a floor plan. One website I found that was helpful was <a href="[url](floorplanner.com)">floorplanner.com</a>  </p>

My goal is to create a building using code floor by floor. I am hoping that the first floor can look something like this.
