## Why architecture?

After looking at different buildings online, I found the building the <a href="/www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/vessel">The Vessel</a> to be the coolest. I was interested in how the building went from design to reality. The giant honeycomb shape and winding staircases is a technological achievement. The digital design tools allow architects to create complex, innovative shapes that would have been impossible to build just a few decades ago. The Vesselâ€™s intricate design, with its precise angles and interwoven staircases, was made possible by advanced software that helped visualize and test the structure before it was built. To help me learn how buildings like these are made I reseached websites like <a href= "https://parametric-architecture.com/technological-advancements-transforming-architecture/"> 8 Technological Advancements Transforming Architecture Today</a> , <a href= "https://www.buildings.com/architecture/article/33037352/7-technological-innovations-shaping-the-future-of-architecture-engineering-and-construction-in-2024"> 7 Technological Innovations Shaping the Future of Architecture, Engineering and Construction in 2024 </a> and <a href= "https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/ai-in-architecture"> How AI in architecture is shaping the future of design and construction</a>. I also read a lot on how The Vessel was designed in <a href= "https://www.architectmagazine.com/project-gallery/vessel_o">Architecture Digest</a>
