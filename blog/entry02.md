## Why architecture?

After looking at different buildings online, I found the building the <a href="/www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/vessel">The Vessel</a> to be the coolest. I was interested in how the building went from design to reality. The giant honeycomb shape and winding staircases is a technological achievement. The digital design tools allow architects to create complex, innovative shapes that would have been impossible to build just a few decades ago. The Vessel’s intricate design, with its precise angles and interwoven staircases, was made possible by advanced software that helped visualize and test the structure before it was built. To help me learn how buildings like these are made I researched websites like <a href= "https://parametric-architecture.com/technological-advancements-transforming-architecture/"> 8 Technological Advancements Transforming Architecture Today</a> , <a href= "https://www.buildings.com/architecture/article/33037352/7-technological-innovations-shaping-the-future-of-architecture-engineering-and-construction-in-2024"> 7 Technological Innovations Shaping the Future of Architecture, Engineering and Construction in 2024 </a> and <a href= "https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/ai-in-architecture"> How AI in architecture is shaping the future of design and construction</a>. I also read a lot on how The Vessel was designed in <a href= "https://www.architectmagazine.com/project-gallery/vessel_o">Architecture Digest</a>  


## EDP
Right now, I’m still in the research phase of the design process. I’m focused on learning how technology, like 3D printing, is being used in architecture. For example, with 3D printing, architects can create samples to pitch to clients in quick speeds. 3D printers can even produce high-quality architectural prototypes to clarify the details of exterior living and entertainment spaces, including swimming pools. It’s an exciting phase because I’m discovering new ways technology can shape the future of architecture and how to explain it to people wanting to learn.


## Skills
The first skill I am learning is how to search for articles online. I am learning to use specific keywords and what are the best sites to use. When searching on Google, I noticed I have to be specific in my search. If not, I get a lot of articles like Wikipedia which does not help me. I am also learning what are the best industry magazines to read are. I am organzing my findings by bookmarking useful articles. This will build a solid base of research for my projects.

I am also learning time management. I have to spend at least an hour for research a few times a week. I’ve started breaking my tasks into smaller steps, like reading one article at a time so I can understand what I am reading. 

## Summary
I still have a lot of research to do but I am learning so much.
