## Why do I love Architecture Designs?

Architectural requirements are those requirements that have a measurable effect on the computer systemâ€™s architecture. This can comprise both software and hardware requirements. They are a subset requirements, the subset of architecture system in identifiable ways.
During my research, I came across several architectural websites that were filled with so many amazing designs and technology on how to build the most magnificant structures, that can stand in place for centuries like the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">The Colosseum</a> The Colosseum is epic and was built as part of an imperial effort to revitalize Rome after the tumultuous year of the four emperors, 69 CE. As with other amphitheatres, the emperor Vespasian intended the Colosseum to be an entertainment venue, hosting gladiator fights, animal hunts, and even mock naval battles. As I mentioned in my last blog [entry02.md ](https://github.com/JulienI9222/sep10-freedom-project/edit/main/blog/entry02.md) Architectural has been the foundation of unbelievable structures that has taken techology and designs to highest level of excellence. <a href= "https://www.buildings.com/architecture/article/33037352/7-technological-innovations-shaping-the-future-of-architecture-engineering-and-construction-in-2024">


## EDP
One of the most important activities in architecture designs is documenting my work which I am preparing and gathering my information to create a user friendly website. I totally agree that communicating the solution on how designing and building the best structures that will hold nature made weather conditions. Communicating the solution to a design problem through language, both written and oral, is a vital part of the implementation phase. Many people you will be communicating with do not have technical training and competence. 

## Skills
I have been researching alot of designs and may get side-track, but I am focusing on my ability to communicate and sell a design solution to others is also a critical skill. You can use graphs, charts, and other visual materials to summarize the solution process and present your work to others. Multimedia techniques, including Power Point presentations, slides, sounds, videos, and computer-generated animations, are often used to clearly communicate the solution to a design problem" The nature of this model is cyclical, and the steps can be revisited as many times as necessary. I want to be able to create a solid foundation both structural and personal to be respected in the industry.

## Summary
I continue my research and try to maintain my composure as this journey in creating a website takes time, patience and skills.
